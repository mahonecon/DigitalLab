WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   U3/currentState[1]_PWR_11_o_Mux_13_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    33 out of  15,850    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           88
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            47 out of      88   53%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              23 out of 126,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
