INFO:Bitgen:40 - Replacing "Auto" with "NoWait" for option "Match_cycle".  Most
   commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the
   generic command-line value of "Auto".  Alternately, this message appears if
   the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this
   case, the option listed last will be used.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   U1/U2/cState[2]_GND_36_o_Mux_8_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U1/U1/U9/Mram_registers11_RAMD_D1_O>
   is incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <U1/U1/U9/Mram_registers2_RAMD_D1_O> is
