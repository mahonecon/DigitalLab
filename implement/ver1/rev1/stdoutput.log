INFO:Bitgen:40 - Replacing "Auto" with "NoWait" for option "Match_cycle".  Most
   commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the
   generic command-line value of "Auto".  Alternately, this message appears if
   the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this
   case, the option listed last will be used.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   U3/currentState[1]_PWR_11_o_Mux_13_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
